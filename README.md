PmliPred is a method based on hybrid model and fuzzy decision for predicting plant miRNA-lncRNA interactions.
The "data" file includes the miRNA-lncRNA interactions of four plant species, where "ath" is A.thaliana, "bdi" is B.distachyon, "osa" is O.sativa and "zma" is Z.mays.
For each plant species, the data include Training dataset, Training feature, Test dataset, Test feature.
"PmliPred (Cross validation).py" and "PmliPred (Independent dataset validation).py" are two Python script, they implement the cross and independent dataset validations described in the manuscript.
